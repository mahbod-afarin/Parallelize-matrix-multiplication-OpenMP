# Parallelize-matrix-multiplication-OpenMP

This project aims to become familiar with OpenMP constructs and programs. The description provides basic practice in coding, compiling, and running OpenMP programs, covering the hello world program, timing, using work sharing for, and sections directives. You are also asked to parallelize matrix multiplication using the work-sharing for directive and draw conclusions. [Here](https://github.com/mahbod-art/Parallelize-matrix-multiplication-OpenMP/blob/main/Report.pdf) is the report, and [here](https://github.com/mahbod-art/Parallelize-matrix-multiplication-OpenMP/blob/main/Project%20Description.pdf) is the project description.
